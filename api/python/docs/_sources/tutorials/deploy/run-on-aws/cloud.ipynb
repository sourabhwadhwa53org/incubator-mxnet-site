    "Deep learning can require extremely powerful hardware, often for\n",
    "unpredictable durations of time. Moreover, *MXNet* can benefit from both multiple GPUs and multiple machines. Accordingly, cloud computing, as offered by AWS and others, is especially well suited to training deep learning models. Using AWS, we can rapidly fire up multiple machines with multiple GPUs each at will and maintain the resources for precisely the amount of time needed.\n",
