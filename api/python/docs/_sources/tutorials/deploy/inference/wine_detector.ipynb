    "# Real-time Object Detection with MXNet On The Raspberry Pi  \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows developers who work with the Raspberry Pi or similar embedded ARM-based devices how to compile MXNet for those devices and run a pretrained deep network model. It also shows how to use AWS IoT to manage and monitor MXNet models running on your devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's In This Tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use MXNet to set up a real-time object classifier on a Raspberry Pi 3 device.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Connect the local Raspberry Pi model to the AWS Cloud with AWS IoT to get real-time updates from the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who's This Tutorial For?\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes that you are familiar with the Raspbian operating system and the [Raspberry Pi ecosystem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and are somewhat familiar with machine learning, MXNet, and [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/). All code is written in Python 2.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this tutorial, you must set up your Pi as instructed (preferably from a fresh Raspbian install), and then create the files and run the bash commands described below. All instructions described are can be executed on the Raspberry Pi directly or via SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build and Install MXNet with Python bindings on your Raspbian Based Raspberry Pi\n",
    "- Fetch and run a pre-trained MXNet model on your Pi\n",
    "- Create a real-time video analysis application for the Pi\n",
    "- Connect the application to the AWS IoT service\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Raspbian Wheezy or later, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), loaded onto a 8GB+ micro SD card (with at least 4GB+ free)\n",
    "* A [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/) or equivalent Raspberry Pi with 1GB+ of RAM\n",
    "* A [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) [activated and running with the corresponding Python module](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/23/install-opencv-and-python-on-your-raspberry-pi-2-and-b/) (for the real-time video analysis with the deep network model)\n",
    "* An AWS account With AWS IoT enabled and the [AWS IoT Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python) (for remote, real-time managing and monitoring of the model running on the Pi)\n",
    "* The [cv2 Python library](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/23/install-opencv-and-python-on-your-raspberry-pi-2-and-b/) for the Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building MXNet for The Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to get MXNet with the Python bindings running on your Raspberry Pi 3. There is a tutorial for that provided [here](https://mxnet.io/get_started). The linked tutorial walks you through downloading the dependencies, and building the full MXNet library for the Pi with the ARM specific compile flags. Be sure to build the library with open CV as we will be using a model that requires it to process images. Then you will register the Python bindings to MXNet. After this is done you should test that your installation works by opening a python REPL on your Pi and typing the following commands:"
