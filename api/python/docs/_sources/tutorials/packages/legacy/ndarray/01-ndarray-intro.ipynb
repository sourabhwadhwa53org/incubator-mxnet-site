    "# An Intro: Manipulate Data the MXNet Way with NDArray\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This guide\n",
    "will introduce you to how data is handled with MXNet. You will learn the basics\n",
    "about MXNet's multi-dimensional array format, `ndarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This content was extracted and simplified from the gluon tutorials in\n",
    "[Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "* [MXNet installed in a Python environment](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started?version=master&platform=linux&language=python&environ=pip&processor=cpu).\n",
    "* Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x\n",

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll get\n",
    "you going with the basic functionality. Don't worry if you don't understand any\n",
    "of the basic math, like element-wise operations or normal distributions. In the\n",
    "next two chapters we'll take another pass at `NDArray`, teaching you both the math\n",
    "you'll need and how to realize it in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's import\n",
    "`mxnet`. We'll also import `ndarray` from `mxnet` for convenience. Weâ€™ll make a\n",
    "habit of setting a random seed so that you always get the same results that we\n",
