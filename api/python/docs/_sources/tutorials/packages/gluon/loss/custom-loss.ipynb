    "All neural networks need a loss function for training. A loss function is a quantitive measure of how bad the predictions of the network are when compared to ground truth labels. Given this score, a network can improve by iteratively updating its weights to minimise this loss. Some tasks use a combination of multiple loss functions, but often you'll just use one. MXNet Gluon provides a number of the most commonly used loss functions, and you'll choose certain functions depending on your network and task. Some common task and loss function pairs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression: [L1Loss](../../../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.L1Loss), [L2Loss](../../../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.L2Loss)\n",
    "- Classification: [SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss](../../../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss), [SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss](../../../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss)\n",
    "- Embeddings: [HingeLoss](../../../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.HingeLoss)\n",

    "However, we may sometimes want to solve problems that require customized loss functions; this tutorial shows how we can do that in Gluon. We will implement contrastive loss which is typically used in Siamese networks."

    "\n",
    "[Contrastive loss](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/hadsell-chopra-lecun-06.pdf) is a distance-based loss function. During training, pairs of images are fed into a model. If the images are similar, the loss function will return 0, otherwise 1.\n",

    "*Y* is a binary label indicating similarity between training images. Contrastive loss uses the Euclidean distance *D* between images and is the sum of 2 terms:\n",
    " - the loss for a pair of similar points\n",
    " - the loss for a pair of dissimilar points\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function uses a margin *m* which is has the effect that dissimlar pairs only contribute if their loss is within a certain margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement such a customized loss function in Gluon, we just need to define a new class that is inheriting from the [Loss](../../../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.Loss) base class. We then define the contrastive loss logic in the [forward](../../../../api/gluon/hybrid_block.rst#mxnet.gluon.HybridBlock.forward) method. This method takes the images `image1`, `image2` and the label which defines whether  `image1` and `image2` are similar (=0) or  dissimilar (=1). Gluon's `Loss` base class is in fact a [HybridBlock](../../../../api/gluon/hybrid_block.rst#mxnet.gluon.HybridBlock), and we hybridize our custom loss function, we can get performance speedups."

    "### Common pitfalls with custom loss functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When customizing loss functions, we may encounter certain pitfalls. If the loss is not decreasing as expected or if forward/backward pass is crashing, then one should check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation function in the last layer\n",
    "Verify whether the last network layer uses the correct activation function: for instance in binary classification tasks we need to apply a sigmoid on the output data. If we use this activation in the last layer and define a loss function like Gluon's SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropy, we would basically apply sigmoid twice and the loss would not converge as expected. If we don't define any activation function, Gluon will per default apply a linear activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Intermediate loss values\n",
    "In our example, we computed the square root of squared distances between 2 images: `F.sqrt(distances_squared)`. If images are very similar we take the sqare root of a value close to 0, which can lead to *NaN* values. Adding a small epsilon to `distances_squared` avoids this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shape of intermediate loss vectors\n",
    "In most cases having the wrong tensor shape will lead to an error, as soon as we compare data with labels. But in some cases, we may be able to normally run the training, but it does not converge. For instance, if we don't set `keepdims=True` in our customized loss function, the shape of the tensor changes. The example still runs fine but does not converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter a similar problem, then it is useful to check the tensor shape after each computation step in the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differentiable\n",
    "Backprogration requires the loss function to be differentiable. If the customized loss function cannot be differentiated the backward pass will crash."
