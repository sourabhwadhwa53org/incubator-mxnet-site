    "# Custom Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gluon API for Apache MxNet comes with [a decent number of pre-defined layers](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/nn.html), at some point one may find that a new layer is needed. Adding a new layer in Gluon API is straightforward, yet there are a few things that one needs to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will cover how to create a new layer from scratch, how to use it, what are possible pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The simplest custom layer\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new layer in Gluon API, one must create a class that inherits from [Block](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/c9818480680f84daa6e281a974ab263691302ba8/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L128) class. This class provides the most basic functionality, and all pre-defined layers inherit from it directly or via other subclasses. Because each layer in Apache MxNet inherits from `Block`, words \"layer\" and \"block\" are used interchangeable inside of the Apache MxNet community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only instance method needed to be implemented is [forward(self, x)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/c9818480680f84daa6e281a974ab263691302ba8/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L909), which defines what exactly your layer is going to do during forward propagation. Notice, that it doesn't require to provide what the block should do during back propogation. Back propogation pass for blocks is done by Apache MxNet for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we define a new layer and implement `forward()` method to normalize input data by fitting it into a range of [0, 1]."

    "The rest of methods of the `Block` class are already implemented, and majority of them are used to work with parameters of a block. There is one very special method named [hybridize()](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L384), though, which I am going to cover before moving to a more complex example of a custom layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hybridization and the difference between Block and HybridBlock\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into implementation of [existing layers](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/nn.html), one may find that more often a block inherits from a [HybridBlock](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L428), instead of directly inheriting from `Block`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for that is that `HybridBlock` allows to write custom layers in imperative programming style, while computing in a symbolic way. It unifies the flexibility of imperative programming with the performance benefits of symbolic programming. You can learn more about the difference between symbolic and imperative programming from [this article](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/architecture/overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybridization is a process that Apache MxNet uses to create a symbolic graph of a forward computation. This allows to increase computation performance by optimizing the computational symbolic graph. Once the symbolic graph is created, Apache MxNet caches and reuses it for subsequent computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybridization of HybridBlock.forward is based on a deferred computation mode in the MXNet backend, which enables recording computation via tracing in the mxnet.nd and mxnet.np interfaces. The recorded computation can be exported to a symbolic representation and is used for optimized execution with the CachedOp.\n",
    "\n",
    "As tracing is based on the imperative APIs, users can access shape information of the arrays. As x.shape for some array x is a python tuple, any use of that shape will be a constant in the recorded graph and may limit the recorded graph to be used with inputs of the same shape only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, we can rewrite our example layer, using HybridBlock:"

    "Unfortunately, at the moment of writing this tutorial, NLP related layers such as [RNN](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/rnn.html#mxnet.gluon.rnn.RNN), [GRU](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/rnn.html#mxnet.gluon.rnn.GRU) and [LSTM](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/rnn.html#mxnet.gluon.rnn.LSTM) are directly inhereting from the `Block` class via common `_RNNLayer` class. That means that networks with such layers cannot be hybridized. But this might change in the future, so stay tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that hybridization has nothing to do with computation on GPU. One can train both hybridized and non-hybridized networks on both CPU and GPU, though hybridized networks would work faster. Though, it is hard to say in advance how much faster it is going to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding a custom layer to a network\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible, custom layers are rarely used separately. Most often they are used with predefined layers to create a neural network. Output of one layer is used as an input of another layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which class you used as a base one, you can use either [Sequential](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Sequential) or [HybridSequential](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridSequential) container to form a sequential neural network. By adding layers one by one, one adds dependencies of one layer's input from another layer's output. It is worth noting, that both `Sequential` and `HybridSequential` containers inherit from `Block` and `HybridBlock` respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how to create a simple neural network with a custom layer. In this example, `NormalizationHybridLayer` gets as an input the output from `Dense(5)` layer and pass its output as an input to `Dense(1)` layer."
