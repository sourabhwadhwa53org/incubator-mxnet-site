    "Deep neural networks are a way to express a nonlinear function with lots of parameters from input data to outputs. The nonlinearities that allow neural networks to capture complex patterns in data are referred to as activation functions. Over the course of the development of neural networks, several nonlinear activation functions have been introduced to make gradient-based deep learning tractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking to answer the question, 'which activation function should I use for my neural network model?', you should probably go with *ReLU*. Unless you're trying to implement something like a gating mechanism, like in LSTMs or GRU cells, then you should opt for sigmoid and/or tanh in those cells. However, if you have a working model architecture and you're trying to improve its performance by swapping out activation functions or treating the activation function as a hyperparameter, then you may want to try hand-designed activations like SELU or a function discovered by reinforcement learning and exhaustive search like Swish. This guide describes these activation functions and others implemented in MXNet in detail.\n",

    "* Activation functions introduce non-linearities to deep neural network that allow the models to capture complex interactions between features of the data.\n",

    "* Sigmoids like the logistic (sigmoid) function and tanh where the first kinds of activation functions used in neural networks. They have since fallen out of use because of their tendency to saturate and have vanishing gradients.\n",
    "* Rectifiers like ReLU do not saturate like the Sigmoids and so address the vanishing gradient problem making them the de facto activation functions. ReLU however is still plagued by the dying ReLU problem.\n",
    "* LeakyReLU and PReLU are two similar approaches to improve ReLU and address the dying ReLU by introducing a parameter $\\alpha$ (learned in PReLU) that leaks to the gradient of negative inputs\n",
