One of the simplest learning rate strategies is to have a fixed learning rate throughout the training process. Choosing a small learning rate allows the optimizer find good solutions, but this comes at the expense of limiting the initial speed of convergence. Changing the learning rate over time can overcome this tradeoff.\n\nSchedules define how the learning rate changes over time and are typically specified for each epoch or iteration (i.e. batch) of training. Schedules differ from adaptive methods (such as AdaDelta and Adam) because they:\n\n* change the global learning rate for the optimizer, rather than parameter-wise learning rates\n* don't take feedback from the training process and are specified beforehand\n\nIn this tutorial, we visualize the schedules defined in `mx.lr_scheduler`, show how to implement custom schedules and see an example of using a schedule while training models. Since schedules are passed to `mx.optimizer.Optimizer` classes, these methods work with both Module and Gluon APIs.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from __future__ import print_function\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport mxnet as mx\nfrom mxnet.gluon import nn\nfrom mxnet.gluon.data.vision import transforms\nimport numpy as np\n%matplotlib inline", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "def plot_schedule(schedule_fn, iterations=1500):\n    # Iteration count starting at 1\n    iterations = [i+1 for i in range(iterations)]\n    lrs = [schedule_fn(i) for i in iterations]\n    plt.scatter(iterations, lrs)\n    plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Learning Rate\")\n    plt.show()", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Schedules\n\nIn this section, we take a look at the schedules in `mx.lr_scheduler`. All of these schedules define the learning rate for a given iteration, and it is expected that iterations start at 1 rather than 0. So to find the learning rate for the 100th iteration, you can call `schedule(100)`.\n\n### Stepwise Decay Schedule\n\nOne of the most commonly used learning rate schedules is called stepwise decay, where the learning rate is reduced by a factor at certain intervals. MXNet implements a `FactorScheduler` for equally spaced intervals, and `MultiFactorScheduler` for greater control. We start with an example of halving the learning rate every 250 iterations. More precisely, the learning rate will be multiplied by `factor` _after_ the `step` index and multiples thereafter. So in the example below the learning rate of the 250th iteration will be 1 and the 251st iteration will be 0.5.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "schedule = mx.lr_scheduler.FactorScheduler(step=250, factor=0.5)\nschedule.base_lr = 1\nplot_schedule(schedule)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "Note: the `base_lr` is used to determine the initial learning rate. It takes a default value of 0.01 since we inherit from `mx.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler`, but it can be set as a property of the schedule. We will see later in this tutorial that `base_lr` is set automatically when providing the `lr_schedule` to `Optimizer`. Also be aware that the schedules in `mx.lr_scheduler` have state (i.e. counters, etc) so calling the schedule out of order may give unexpected results.\n\nWe can define non-uniform intervals with `MultiFactorScheduler` and in the example below we halve the learning rate _after_ the 250th, 750th (i.e. a step length of 500 iterations) and 900th (a step length of 150 iterations). As before, the learning rate of the 250th iteration will be 1 and the 251th iteration will be 0.5.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "schedule = mx.lr_scheduler.MultiFactorScheduler(step=[250, 750, 900], factor=0.5)\nschedule.base_lr = 1\nplot_schedule(schedule)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Polynomial Schedule\n\nStepwise schedules and the discontinuities they introduce may sometimes lead to instability in the optimization, so in some cases smoother schedules are preferred. `PolyScheduler` gives a smooth decay using a polynomial function and reaches a learning rate of 0 after `max_update` iterations. In the example below, we have a quadratic function (`pwr=2`) that falls from 0.998 at iteration 1 to 0 at iteration 1000. After this the learning rate stays at 0, so nothing will be learnt from `max_update` iterations onwards.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "schedule = mx.lr_scheduler.PolyScheduler(max_update=1000, base_lr=1, pwr=2)\nplot_schedule(schedule)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "Note: unlike `FactorScheduler`, the `base_lr` is set as an argument when instantiating the schedule.\n\nAnd we don't evaluate at `iteration=0` (to get `base_lr`) since we are working with schedules starting at `iteration=1`.\n\n### Custom Schedules\n\nYou can implement your own custom schedule with a function or callable class, that takes an integer denoting the iteration index (starting at 1) and returns a float representing the learning rate to be used for that iteration. We implement the Cosine Annealing Schedule in the example below as a callable class (see `__call__` method).", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "class CosineAnnealingSchedule():\n    def __init__(self, min_lr, max_lr, cycle_length):\n        self.min_lr = min_lr\n        self.max_lr = max_lr\n        self.cycle_length = cycle_length\n        \n    def __call__(self, iteration):\n        if iteration <= self.cycle_length:\n            unit_cycle = (1 + math.cos(iteration * math.pi / self.cycle_length)) / 2\n            adjusted_cycle = (unit_cycle * (self.max_lr - self.min_lr)) + self.min_lr\n            return adjusted_cycle\n        else:\n            return self.min_lr\n\n\nschedule = CosineAnnealingSchedule(min_lr=0, max_lr=1, cycle_length=1000)\nplot_schedule(schedule)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Using Schedules\n\nWhile training a simple handwritten digit classifier on the MNIST dataset, we take a look at how to use a learning rate schedule during training.
