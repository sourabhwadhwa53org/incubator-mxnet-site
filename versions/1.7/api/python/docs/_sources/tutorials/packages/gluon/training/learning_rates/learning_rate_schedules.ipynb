    "# Learning Rate Schedules\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucially important when training neural networks because it controls both the speed of convergence and the ultimate performance of the network. One of the simplest learning rate strategies is to have a fixed learning rate throughout the training process. Choosing a small learning rate allows the optimizer find good solutions, but this comes at the expense of limiting the initial speed of convergence. Changing the learning rate over time can overcome this tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedules define how the learning rate changes over time and are typically specified for each epoch or iteration (i.e. batch) of training. Schedules differ from adaptive methods (such as AdaDelta and Adam) because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "* change the global learning rate for the optimizer, rather than parameter-wise learning rates\n",
    "* don't take feedback from the training process and are specified beforehand\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we visualize the schedules defined in `mx.lr_scheduler`, show how to implement custom schedules and see an example of using a schedule while training models. Since schedules are passed to `mx.optimizer.Optimizer` classes, these methods work with both Module and Gluon APIs."

    "\n",
    "### Stepwise Decay Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used learning rate schedules is called stepwise decay, where the learning rate is reduced by a factor at certain intervals. MXNet implements a `FactorScheduler` for equally spaced intervals, and `MultiFactorScheduler` for greater control. We start with an example of halving the learning rate every 250 iterations. More precisely, the learning rate will be multiplied by `factor` _after_ the `step` index and multiples thereafter. So in the example below the learning rate of the 250th iteration will be 1 and the 251st iteration will be 0.5."

It takes a default value of 0.01 since we inherit from `mx.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler`, but it can be set as a property of the schedule. We will see later in this tutorial that `base_lr` is set automatically when providing the `lr_schedule` to `Optimizer`. Also be aware that the schedules in `mx.lr_scheduler` have state (i.e. counters, etc) so calling the schedule out of order may give unexpected results.\n",

As before, the learning rate of the 250th iteration will be 1 and the 251th iteration will be 0.5."

In the example below, we have a quadratic function (`pwr=2`) that falls from 0.998 at iteration 1 to 0 at iteration 1000. After this the learning rate stays at 0, so nothing will be learnt from `max_update` iterations onwards."
