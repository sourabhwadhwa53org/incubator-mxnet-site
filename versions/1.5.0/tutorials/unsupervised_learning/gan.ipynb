The Generator tries to create realistic data, so that it can fool the Discriminator into thinking that the data it generated is from the original dataset. At the same time, the Discriminator tries to not be fooled - it learns to become better at determining if data is real or fake.\n\nSince the two networks are fighting in this game, they can be seen as as adversaries, which is where the term \"Generative Adversarial Network\" comes from.\n\n## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nThis tutorial takes a look at Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and GANs.\n\nWe will create a DCGAN that is able to create images of handwritten digits from random numbers. The tutorial uses the neural net architecture and guidelines outlined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434), and the MNIST dataset.\n\n## How to Use This Tutorial\nYou can use this tutorial by executing each snippet of python code in order as it appears in the tutorial.\n\n\n1. The first net is the \"Generator\" and creates images of handwritten digits from random numbers.\n2. The second net is the \"Discriminator\" and determines if the image created by the Generator is real (a realistic looking image of handwritten digits) or fake (an image that does not look like it is from the original dataset).\n\nApart from creating a DCGAN, you'll also learn:\n\n- How to manipulate and iterate through batches of image data that you can feed into your neural network.\n\n- How to create a custom MXNet data iterator that generates random numbers from a normal distribution.\n\n- How to create a custom training process in MXNet, using lower level functions from the MXNet Module API such as .bind() .forward() and .backward(). The training process for a DCGAN is more complex than many other neural networks, so we need to use these functions instead of using the higher level .fit() function.\n\n- How to visualize images as they are going through the training process\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis tutorial assumes you are familiar with the concepts of CNNs and have implemented one in MXNet. You should also be familiar with the concept of logistic regression. Having a basic understanding of MXNet data iterators helps, since we will create a custom data iterator to iterate though random numbers as inputs to the Generator network.\n\nThis example is designed to be trained on a single GPU. Training this network on CPU can be slow, so it's recommended that you use a GPU for training.\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need:\n\n- MXNet\n- Python, and the following libraries for Python:\n    - Numpy - for matrix math\n    - OpenCV - for image manipulation\n    - Matplotlib - to visualize the output\n\n## The Data\nWe need two pieces of data to train the DCGAN:\n    1. Images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset\n    2. Random numbers from a normal distribution\n\nThe Generator network will use the random numbers as the input to produce the images of handwritten digits, and the Discriminator network will use images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset to determine if images produced by the Generator are realistic.\n\nThe MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size. To create random numbers, we're going to create a custom MXNet data iterator, which will returns random numbers from a normal distribution as we need then.\n\n## Prepare the Data\n\n### 1.

We apply batch normalization and ReLU activation after the Deconvolution layer.\n\nWe repeat this process 4 times, applying a (2,2) stride and (1,1) pad at each Deconvolution layer, which doubles the size of the image at each layer. By creating these layers, the Generator network will have to learn to upsample the input vector of random numbers, Z at each layer, so that network output a final image. We also reduce by half the number of filters at each layer, reducing dimensionality at each layer. Ultimately, the output layer is a 64x64x3 layer, representing the size and channels of the image. We use tanh activation instead of relu on the last layer, as recommended by the research on DCGANs. The output of neurons in the final gout layer represent the pixels of generated image.\n\nNotice we used 3 parameters to help us create the model: no_bias, fixed_gamma, and epsilon. Neurons in the network won't have a bias added to them, this seems to work better in practice for the DCGAN. In the batch norm layer, we set fixed_gamma=True, which means gamma=1 for all of the batch norm layers. epsilon is a small number that gets added to the batch norm so that we don't end up dividing by zero. By default, CuDNN requires that this number is greater than 1e-5, so we add a small number to this value, ensuring this values stays small.\n\n### The Discriminator\n\nLet us now create the Discriminator network, which will take in images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset and images created by the Generator network:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "data = mx.sym.Variable('data')\n\nd1 = mx.sym.Convolution(data, name='d1', kernel=(4,4), stride=(2,2), pad=(1,1), num_filter=128, no_bias=no_bias)\ndact1 = mx.sym.LeakyReLU(d1, name='dact1', act_type='leaky', slope=0.2)\n\nd2 = mx.sym.Convolution(dact1, name='d2', kernel=(4,4), stride=(2,2), pad=(1,1), num_filter=256, no_bias=no_bias)\ndbn2 = mx.sym.BatchNorm(d2, name='dbn2', fix_gamma=fix_gamma, eps=epsilon)\ndact2 = mx.sym.LeakyReLU(dbn2, name='dact2', act_type='leaky', slope=0.2)\n\nd3 = mx.sym.Convolution(dact2, name='d3', kernel=(4,4), stride=(2,2), pad=(1,1), num_filter=512, no_bias=no_bias)\ndbn3 = mx.sym.BatchNorm(d3, name='dbn3', fix_gamma=fix_gamma, eps=epsilon)\ndact3 = mx.sym.LeakyReLU(dbn3, name='dact3', act_type='leaky', slope=0.2)\n\nd4 = mx.sym.Convolution(dact3, name='d4', kernel=(4,4), stride=(2,2), pad=(1,1), num_filter=1024, no_bias=no_bias)\ndbn4 = mx.sym.BatchNorm(d4, name='dbn4', fix_gamma=fix_gamma, eps=epsilon)\ndact4 = mx.sym.LeakyReLU(dbn4, name='dact4', act_type='leaky', slope=0.2)\n\nd5 = mx.sym.Convolution(dact4, name='d5', kernel=(4,4), num_filter=1, no_bias=no_bias)\nd5 = mx.sym.Flatten(d5)\n\nlabel = mx.sym.Variable('label')\ndiscriminatorSymbol = mx.sym.LogisticRegressionOutput(data=d5, label=label, name='dloss')", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "We start off by creating the data variable, which is used to hold the input images to the Discriminator.\n\nThe Discriminator then goes through a series of 5 convolutional layers, each with a 4x4 kernel, 2x2 stride, and 1x1 pad. These layers half the size of the image (which starts at 64x64) at each convolutional layer. The model also increases dimensionality at each layer by doubling the number of filters per convolutional layer, starting at 128 filters and ending at 1024 filters before we flatten the output.\n\nAt the final convolution, we flatten the neural net to get one number as the final output of Discriminator network. This number is the probability that the image is real, as determined by the Discriminator. We use logistic regression to determine this probability. When we pass in \"real\" images from the MNIST dataset, we can label these as 1 and we can label the \"fake\" images from the Generator net as 0 to perform logistic regression on the Discriminator network.\n\n### Prepare the models using the Module API\n\nSo far we have defined a MXNet Symbol for both the Generator and the Discriminator network. Before we can train the model, we need to bind these symbols using the Module API, which creates the computation graph for the models. It also allows us to decide how we want to initialize the model and what type of optimizer we want to use.

This means the weight initializations for the neurons in the networks will be random numbers from a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.02.\n\nWe also use the Adam optimizer for gradient decent.

You can see this happening since the images on the left becomes closer to the original dataset with each iteration.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe have now successfully used Apache MXNet to train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (DCGAN) using the MNIST dataset.\n\nAs a result, we have created two neural nets: a Generator, which is able to create images of handwritten digits from random numbers, and a Discriminator, which is able to take an image and determine if it is an image of handwritten digits.\n\nAlong the way, we have learned how to do the image manipulation and visualization that is associated with the training of deep neural nets. We have also learned how to use MXNet's Module APIs to perform advanced model training functionality to fit the model.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis tutorial is based on [MXNet DCGAN codebase](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/gluon/dc_gan/dcgan.py),\n[The original paper on GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), as well as [this paper on deep convolutional GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).\n\n<!-- INSERT SOURCE DOWNLOAD BUTTONS -->\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"display_name": "", "name": "", "language": "python"}, "nbformat_minor": 2}
