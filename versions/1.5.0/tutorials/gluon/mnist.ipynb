It consists of 70,000 labeled grayscale images of hand-written digits, each 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model that can correctly classify the images into the digits they represent. The 60,000 training images are used to fit the model, and its performance in terms of classification accuracy is subsequently validated on the 10,000 test images.\n\n![png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/example/mnist.png)\n\n**Figure 1:** Sample images from the MNIST dataset.\n\nThis tutorial uses MXNet's high-level *Gluon* interface to implement neural networks in an imperative fashion. It is based on [the corresponding tutorial written with the symbolic approach](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/python/mnist.html).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need:\n\n- MXNet. See the instructions for your operating system in [Setup and Installation](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/index.html).\n- The Python [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.\n- (Optional) The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) software for interactively running the provided `.ipynb` file.\n\n```\n$ pip install requests jupyter\n```\n\n## Loading Data\n\nThe following code downloads the MNIST dataset to the default location (`.mxnet/datasets/mnist/` in your home directory) and creates `Dataset` objects `train_data` and `val_data` for training and validation, respectively.\nThese objects can later be used to get one image or a batch of images at a time, together with their corresponding labels.\n\nWe also immediately apply the `transform_first()` method and supply a function that moves the channel axis of the images to the beginning (`(28, 28, 1) -> (1, 28, 28)`), casts them to `float32` and rescales them from `[0, 255]` to `[0, 1]`.\nThe name `transform_first` reflects the fact that these datasets contain images and labels, and that the transform should only be applied to the first of each `(image, label)` pair.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "import mxnet as mx\n\n# Select a fixed random seed for

larger datasets like ImageNet, this would no longer be possible.\nThe Gluon `Dataset` class from which `MNIST` derives supports both cases.\nIn general, `Dataset` and `DataLoader` (which we will encounter next) are the machinery in MXNet that provides a stream of input data to be consumed by a training algorithm, typically in batches of multiple data entities at once for better efficiency.\nIn this tutorial, we will configure the data loader to feed examples in batches of 100.\n\nAn image batch is commonly represented as a 4-D array with shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`.\nThis convention is denoted by \"NCHW\", and it is the default in MXNet.\nFor the MNIST dataset, each image has a size of 28x28 pixels and one color channel (grayscale), hence the shape of an input batch will be `(batch_size, 1, 28, 28)`.\n\nAnother important consideration is the order of input samples.\nWhen feeding training examples, it is critical not feed samples with the same label in succession since doing so can slow down training progress.\nData iterators, i.e., instances of [`DataLoader`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/data.html#mxnet.gluon.data.DataLoader), take care of this issue by randomly shuffling the inputs.\nNote that we only need to shuffle

first attempt, we will make use of a traditional neural network architecture called [Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron).\nAlthough this architecture lets us achieve over 95 % accuracy on the validation set, we will recognize and discuss some of its drawbacks and use them as a motivation for using a different network.\nIn the subsequent second attempt, we introduce the more advanced and very widely used [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) architecture that has proven to work very well for image classification tasks.\n\nAs a first step, we run some convenience imports of frequently used modules.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from __future__ import

"metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Defining a network: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\n\nMLPs consist of several fully connected layers.\nIn a fully connected (short: FC) layer, each neuron is connected to every neuron in its preceding layer.\nFrom a linear algebra perspective, an FC layer applies an [affine transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) *Y = X W + b* to an input matrix *X* of size (*n x m*) and outputs a matrix *Y* of size (*n x k*).\nThe number *k*, also referred to as *hidden size*, corresponds to the number of neurons in the FC layer.\nAn FC layer has two learnable parameters: the (*m x k*) weight matrix *W* and the (*1 x k*) bias vector *b*.\n\nIn an MLP, the outputs of FC layers are typically fed into an activation function that applies an elementwise nonlinearity.\nThis step is crucial since it gives neural networks the ability to classify inputs that are not linearly separable.\nCommon choices for activation functions are [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), [hyperbolic tangent (\"tanh\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function#Definitions), and [rectified linear unit (ReLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)).\nIn this example, we'll use the ReLU activation function since it has several nice properties that make it a good default choice.\n\nThe following code snippet declares three fully connected (or *dense*) layers with 128, 64 and 10 neurons each, where the last number of neurons matches the number of output classes in our dataset.\nNote that the last layer uses no activation function since the [softmax](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.softmax) activation will be implicitly applied by the loss function later on.\nTo build the neural network, we use a [`HybridSequential`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridSequential) layer, which is a convenience class to build a linear stack of layers, often called a *feed-forward neural net*.\n\nThe \"Hybrid\" part of name `HybridSequential` refers to the fact that such a layer can be used with both the Gluon API and the Symbol API.\nUsing hybrid blocks over dynamic-only blocks (e.g. [`Sequential`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Sequential)) has several advantages apart from being compatible with a wider range of existing code: for instance, the computation graph of the network can be visualized with `mxnet.viz.plot_network()` and inspected for errors.\nUnless a network requires non-static runtime elements like loops, conditionals or random layer selection in its forward pass, it is generally a good idea to err on the side of hybrid blocks.\nFor details on the differences, see the documentation on [`Block`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.Block) and

the `name_scope()` context manager is optional.\nIt is, however, good practice since it uses a common prefix for the names of all layers generated in that scope, which can be very helpful during debugging.\n\n#### Initializing parameters and optimizer\n\nBefore the network can be used, its parameters (weights and biases) need to be set to initial values that are sufficiently random while keeping the magnitude of gradients limited.\nThe [Xavier](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/optimization/optimization.html#mxnet.initializer.Xavier) initializer is usually a good default choice.\n\nSince the `net.initialize()` method creates arrays for its parameters, it needs to know where to store the values: in CPU or GPU memory.\nLike many other functions and classes that deal

(SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) optimizer.\nMore specifically, we use mini-batch SGD in contrast to the classical SGD that processes one example at a time, which is very slow in practice.\n(Recall that we set the batch size to 100 in the [\"Loading Data\"](#loading-data) part.)\n\nBesides the batch size, the SGD algorithm has one important *hyperparameter*: the *learning rate*.\nIt determines the size of steps that the algorithm takes in search of parameters that allow the network to optimally fit the training data.\nTherefore, this value has great influence on both the course of the training process and its final outcome.\nIn general, hyperparameters refer to *non-learnable* values that need to be chosen before training and that have a potential effect on the outcome.\nIn this example, further hyperparameters are the number of layers in the network, the number of neurons of the first two layers, the activation function and (later) the loss function.\n\nThe SGD optimization method can be accessed in MXNet Gluon through the [`Trainer`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#trainer) class.\nInternally, it makes use

{"source": "#### Training\n\nTraining the network requires a way to tell how well the network currently fits the training data.\nFollowing common practice in optimization, this quality of fit is expressed through a *loss value* (also referred to as badness-of-fit or data discrepancy), which the algorithm then tries to minimize by adjusting the weights of the model.\n\nIdeally, in a classification task, we would like to use the prediction inaccuracy, i.e., the fraction of incorrectly classified samples, to guide the training to a lower value.\nUnfortunately, inaccuracy is a poor choice for training since it contains almost no information that can be used to update the network parameters (its gradient is zero almost everywhere).\nAs a better behaved proxy for inaccuracy, the [softmax cross-entropy loss](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/loss.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss) is a popular choice.\nIt has the essential property of being minimal for the correct prediction, but at the same time, it is everywhere differentiable with nonzero gradient.\nThe [accuracy](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/metric/metric.html#mxnet.metric.Accuracy) metric is still useful for monitoring the training progress, since it is more intuitively interpretable than a loss value.\n\n**Note:** `SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss` combines the softmax activation and the cross entropy loss function in one layer, therefore the last layer in our network has no

pass over the data is usually called an *epoch*.\n\nThe following steps are taken in each `epoch`:\n\n- Get a minibatch of `inputs` and `labels` from the `train_loader`.\n- Feed the `inputs` to the network, producing `outputs`.\n- Compute the minibatch `loss` value by comparing `outputs` to `labels`.\n- Use backpropagation to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to each of the network parameters by calling `loss.backward()`.\n- Update the parameters of the network according to the optimizer rule with `trainer.step(batch_size=inputs.shape[0])`.\n- Print the current accuracy over the

the above training has completed, we can evaluate the trained model by comparing predictions from the validation dataset with their respective correct labels.\nIt is important to notice that the validation data was not used during training, i.e., the network has not seen the images and their true labels yet.\nKeeping a part of the data aside for validation is crucial for detecting *overfitting* of a network: If a neural network has enough parameters, it can simply memorize the training data and look up the true label for a given training image.\nWhile this results in 100 % training accuracy, such an overfit model would perform very poorly on new data.\nIn other words, an overfit model does not generalize to a broader class of inputs than the training set, and such an

really great on this dataset, as can be seen from the fact that some of the mislabeled examples are rather \"easy\" and should not be a challenge for our neural net.\nAs it turns out, moving to the CNN architecture presented in the following section will give a big performance boost.\n\n### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n\nA fundamental issue with the MLP network is that it requires the inputs to be flattened (in the non-batch axes) before they can be processed by the dense layers.\nThis means in particular that the spatial structure of an image is largely discarded, and that the values describing it are just treated as a long vector.\nThe network then has to figure out the neighborhood relations of pixels from scratch by adjusting its weights accordingly, which seems very wasteful.\n\nA CNN aims to address this problem by using a more structured weight representation.\nInstead of connecting all inputs to all outputs, the characteristic [convolution layer](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/nn.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2D) only considers a small neighborhood of a pixel to compute the value of the corresponding output pixel.\nIn particular, the spatial structure of the image is preserved, i.e., one can speak of input and output pixels in the first place.\nOnly the size of the image may change through convolutions.\n[This article](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html) gives a good and intuitive explanation of convolutions in the context of deep learning.\n\nThe size of the neighborhood that a convolution layer considers for each pixel is usually referred to as *filter size* or *kernel size*.\nThe array of weights -- which does not depend on the output pixel location, only on the position within such a neighborhood -- is called *filter* or *kernel*.\nTypical filter sizes range from *3 x 3* to *13 x 13*, which implies that a convolution layer has *far* fewer parameters than a dense layer.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "conv_layer = nn.Conv2D(kernel_size=(3, 3), channels=32, in_channels=16, activation='relu')\nprint(conv_layer.params)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "Filters can be thought of as little feature detectors: in early layers, they learn to detect small local structures like edges, whereas later layers become sensitive to more and more global structures.\nSince images often contain a rich set of such features, it is customary to have each convolution layer employ and learn many different filters in parallel, so as to detect many different image features on their respective scales.\nThis stacking of filters, which directly translates to a stacking of output images, is referred to as output *channels* of the convolution layer.\nLikewise, the input can already have multiple channels.\nIn the above example, the convolution layer takes an input image with 16 channels and maps it to an image with 32 channels by convolving each of the input channels with a different set of 32 filters and then summing over the 16 input channels.\nTherefore, the total number of filter parameters in the convolution layer is `channels * in_channels * prod(kernel_size)`, which amounts to 4608 in the above example.\n\nAnother characteristic feature of CNNs is the usage of *pooling*, i.e., summarizing patches to a single number, to shrink the size of an image as it travels through the layers.\nThis step lowers the computational burden of training the network, but the main motivation for pooling is the assumption that it makes the network less sensitive to small translations, rotations or deformations of the image.\nPopular pooling strategies are max-pooling and average-pooling, and they are usually performed after convolution.\n\nThe following code defines a CNN architecture called *LeNet*.\nThe LeNet architecture is a popular network known to work well on
