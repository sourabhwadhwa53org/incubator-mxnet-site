With declarative frameworks (including Tensorflow, Theano, etc)\nusers first declare a fixed computation graph and then execute it end-to-end.\nThe benefit of fixed computation graph is it's portable and runs more\nefficiently. However, it's less flexible because any logic must be encoded\ninto the graph as special operators like `scan`, `while_loop` and `cond`.\nIt's also hard to debug.\n\nImperative frameworks (including PyTorch, Chainer, etc) are just the opposite:\nthey execute commands one-by-one just like old fashioned Matlab and Numpy.\nThis style is more flexible, easier to debug, but less efficient.\n\n`HybridBlock` seamlessly combines declarative programming and imperative programming\nto offer the benefit of both. Users can quickly develop and debug models with\nimperative programming and switch to efficient declarative execution by simply\ncalling: `HybridBlock.hybridize()`.\n\n## HybridBlock\n\n`HybridBlock` is very similar to `Block` but has a few restrictions:\n\n- All children layers of `HybridBlock` must also be `HybridBlock`.\n- Only methods that are implemented for both `NDArray` and `Symbol` can be used.\n  For example you cannot use `.asnumpy()`, `.shape`, etc.\n- Operations cannot change from run to run. For example, you cannot do `if x:`\n  if `x` is different for each iteration.\n\nTo use hybrid support, we subclass the `HybridBlock`:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "import mxnet as mx\nfrom mxnet import gluon\nfrom mxnet.gluon import nn\n\nmx.random.seed(42)\n\nclass Net(gluon.HybridBlock):\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        super(Net, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n        with self.name_scope():\n            # layers created in name_scope will inherit name space\n            # from parent layer.\n            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2D(6, kernel_size=5)\n            self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2D(pool_size=2)\n            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2D(16, kernel_size=5)\n            self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2D(pool_size=2)\n            self.fc1 = nn.Dense(120)\n            self.fc2 = nn.Dense(84)\n            # You can use a Dense layer for fc3 but we do dot product manually\n            # here for illustration purposes.\n            self.fc3_weight = self.params.get('fc3_weight', shape=(10, 84))\n\n    def hybrid_forward(self, F, x, fc3_weight):\n        # Here `F` can be either mx.nd or mx.sym, x is the input data,\n        # and fc3_weight is either self.fc3_weight.data() or\n        # self.fc3_weight.var() depending on whether x is Symbol or NDArray\n        print(x)\n        x = self.pool1(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n        x = self.pool2(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\n        # 0 means copy over size from corresponding dimension.\n        # -1 means infer size from the rest of dimensions.\n        x = x.reshape((0, -1))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = F.dot(x, fc3_weight, transpose_b=True)\n        return x", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Hybridize\n\nBy default, `HybridBlock` runs just like a standard `Block`.

While most APIs are the same in NDArray and Symbol, there are some differences. Writing `F.some_operator` and call `hybridize` may not work all of the time.\nHere we list some frequently used NDArray APIs that can't be hybridized and provide you the work arounds.  \n\n### Element-wise Operators\n\nIn NDArray APIs, the following arithmetic and comparison APIs are automatically broadcasted if the input NDArrays have different shapes.\nHowever, that's not the case in Symbol API. It's not automatically broadcasted, and you have to manually specify to use another set of broadcast operators for Symbols expected to have different shapes.\n\n\n```eval_rst\n.. list-table::\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * -

However, Symbol does not have shape attributes. As a result, you need to avoid printing shapes in `hybrid_forward`.\nOtherwise, you will get the following error:\n```\nAttributeError: 'Symbol' object has no attribute 'shape'\n```\n\n### Slice\n`[]` in NDArray is used to get a slice from the array. However, `[]` in Symbol is used to get an output from a grouped symbol.\nFor example, you will get different results for the following method before and after hybridization.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "def hybrid_forward(self, F, x):\n    return x[0]", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "\nThe current workaround is to explicitly call [`slice`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.slice) or [`slice_axis`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.slice_axis) operators in `hybrid_forward`.\n\n\n### Not implemented operators\n\nSome of the often used operators in NDArray are not implemented in Symbol, and will cause hybridization failure.\n\n#### NDArray.asnumpy\nSymbol does not support the `asnumpy` function. You need to avoid calling `asnumpy` in `hybrid_forward`.\n\n#### Array creation APIs\n\n`mx.nd.array()` is used a lot, but Symbol does not have the `array` API. The current workaround is to use `F.ones`, `F.zeros`, or `F.full`, which exist in both the NDArray and Symbol APIs.\n\n#### In-Place Arithmetic Operators\n\nIn-place arithmetic operators may be used in Gluon imperative mode, however if you expect to hybridize, you should write these operations explicitly instead.\nFor example, avoid writing `x += y` and use `x  = x + y`, otherwise you will get `NotImplementedError`. This applies to all the following operators:\n\n```eval_rst\n.. list-table::\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * - NDArray in-place arithmetic operators \n     - Description \n   * - `NDArray.\\_\\ *iadd\\_* <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.__iadd__>`__ \n     - ::      x.\\__iadd\\__(y) <=> x+=y  \n   * - `NDArray.\\_\\ *isub\\_* <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.__isub__>`__ \n     - ::      x.\\__isub\\__(y) <=> x-=y  \n   * - `NDArray.\\_\\ *imul\\_* <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.__imul__>`__ \n     - ::      x.\\__imul\\__(y) <=> x*=y  \n   * - `NDArray.\\_\\ *idiv\\_* <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.__idiv__>`__ \n     - ::      x.\\__rdiv\\__(y) <=> x/=y  \n   * - `NDArray.\\_\\ *imod\\_* <https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.__imod__>`__ \n     - ::      x.\\__rmod\\__(y) <=> x%=y  \n```\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThe recommended practice is to utilize the flexibility of imperative NDArray API during experimentation. Once you finalized your model, make necessary changes mentioned above so you can call `hybridize` function to improve performance.\n\n<!-- INSERT SOURCE DOWNLOAD BUTTONS -->\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"display_name": "", "name": "", "language": "python"}, "nbformat_minor": 2}
