Set the learning too low and you could be twiddling your thumbs for quite some time as the parameters update very slowly. Set it too high and the updates will skip over optimal solutions, or worse the optimizer might not converge at all!\n\nLeslie Smith from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory presented a method for finding a good learning rate in a paper called [\"Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186). We implement this method in MXNet (with the Gluon API) and create a 'Learning Rate Finder' which you can use while training your own networks. We take a look at the central idea of the paper, cyclical learning rate schedules, in the ['Advanced Learning Rate Schedules'](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/gluon/learning_rate_schedules_advanced.html) tutorial.\n\n## Simple Idea\n\nGiven an initialized network, a defined loss and a training dataset we take the following steps:\n\n1. Train one batch at a time (a.k.a. an iteration)\n2. Start with a very small learning rate (e.g. 0.000001) and slowly increase it every iteration\n3. Record the training loss and continue until we see the training loss diverge\n\nWe then analyse the results by plotting a graph of the learning rate against the training loss as seen below (taking note of the log scales).\n\n\nAs expected, for very small learning rates we don't see much change in the loss as the parameter updates are negligible. At a learning rate of 0.001, we start to see the loss fall. Setting the initial learning rate here is reasonable, but we still have the potential to learn faster. We observe a drop in the loss up until 0.1 where the loss appears to diverge. We want to set the initial learning rate as high as possible before the loss becomes unstable, so we choose a learning rate of 0.05.\n\n## Epoch to Iteration\n\nUsually, our unit of work is an epoch (a full pass through the dataset) and the learning rate would typically be held constant throughout the epoch. With the Learning Rate Finder (and cyclical learning rate schedules) we are required to vary the learning rate every iteration. As such we structure our training code so that a single iteration can be run with a given learning rate. You can implement Learner as you wish. Just initialize the network, define the loss and trainer in `__init__` and keep your training logic for a single batch in `iteration`.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "import mxnet as mx\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nmx.random.seed(42)\n\nclass Learner():\n    def __init__(self, net, data_loader, ctx):\n        \"\"\"\n        :param net: network (mx.gluon.Block)\n        :param data_loader: training data loader (mx.gluon.data.DataLoader)\n        :param ctx: context (mx.gpu or mx.cpu)\n        \"\"\"\n        self.net = net\n        self.data_loader = data_loader\n        self.ctx = ctx\n        # So we don't need to be in `for batch in data_loader` scope\n        # and can call for next batch in `iteration`\n        self.data_loader_iter = iter(self.data_loader)\n        self.net.initialize(mx.init.Xavier(), ctx=self.ctx)\n        self.loss_fn = mx.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss()\n        self.trainer = mx.gluon.Trainer(net.collect_params(), 'sgd', {'learning_rate': .001})\n        \n    def iteration(self, lr=None, take_step=True):\n        \"\"\"\n        :param lr: learning rate to use for iteration (float)\n        :param take_step: take trainer step to update weights (boolean)\n        :return: iteration loss (float)\n        \"\"\"\n        # Update learning rate if different this iteration\n        if lr and (lr != self.trainer.learning_rate):\n            self.trainer.set_learning_rate(lr)\n        # Get next batch, and move context (e.g. to GPU if set)\n        data, label = next(self.data_loader_iter)\n        data = data.as_in_context(self.ctx)\n        label = label.as_in_context(self.ctx)\n        # Standard forward and backward pass\n        with mx.autograd.record():\n            output = self.net(data)\n            loss = self.loss_fn(output, label)\n        loss.backward()     \n        # Update parameters\n        if take_step: self.trainer.step(data.shape[0])  \n        # Set and return loss.\n        self.iteration_loss = mx.nd.mean(loss).asscalar()\n        return self.iteration_loss\n\n    def close(self):\n        # Close open iterator and associated workers\n        self.data_loader_iter.shutdown()", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "We also adjust our `DataLoader` so that it continuously provides batches of data and doesn't stop after a single epoch.
