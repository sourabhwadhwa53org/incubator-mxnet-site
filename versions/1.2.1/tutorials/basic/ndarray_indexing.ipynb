You will see direct adaptations of many NumPy indexing features and examples which are close, if not identical, so we borrow much from their documentation.\n\n`NDArray`s can be indexed using the standard Python `x[obj]` syntax, where _x_ is the array and _obj_ the selection.\n\nThere are two kinds of indexing available:\n\n1. basic slicing\n1. advanced indexing\n\nIn MXNet, we support both basic and advanced indexing following the convention of indexing NumPy's `ndarray`.\n\n\n## Basic Slicing and Indexing\n\nBasic slicing extends Python's basic concept of slicing to N dimensions. For a quick review:\n\n```\na[start:end] # items start through end-1\na[start:]    # items start through the rest of the array\na[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1\na[:]         # a copy of the whole array\n```", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from mxnet import nd", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "For some working examples of basic slicing we'll start simple.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "x = nd.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], dtype='int32')\nx[5:]", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "    [5 6 7 8 9]\n    <NDArray 5 @cpu(0)>", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "x = nd.array([0, 1, 2, 3])\nprint('1D complete array, x=', x)\ns = x[1:3]\nprint('slicing the 2nd and 3rd elements, s=', s)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "    1D complete array, x=\n    [ 0.  1.  2.  3.]\n    <NDArray 4 @cpu(0)>\n    slicing the 2nd and 3rd elements, s=\n    [ 1.  2.]\n    <NDArray 2 @cpu(0)>\n\n\nNow let's try slicing the 2nd and 3rd elements of a multi-dimensional array.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "x = nd.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])\nprint('multi-D complete array, x=', x)\ns = x[1:3]\nprint('slicing the 2nd and 3rd elements, s=', s)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "    multi-D complete array, x=\n    [[  1.   2.   3.   4.]\n     [  5.   6.   7.   8.]\n     [  9.  10.  11.  12.]]\n    <NDArray 3x4 @cpu(0)>\n    slicing the 2nd and 3rd elements, s=\n    [[  5.   6.   7.   8.]\n     [  9.  10.  11.  12.]]\n    <NDArray 2x4 @cpu(0)>\n\n\nNow let's try writing to a specific element.

MXNet does not support the selection object being a nested list. That is, `x[[1, 2]]` is supported, while `x[[1], [2]]` is not.\n- When the selection object is a NumPy `ndarray` or an MXNet `NDArray`, there is no dimension restrictions on the object.\n- When the selection object is a tuple containing Python list(s), both integer lists and nested lists are supported. That is, both `x[1:4, [1, 2]]` and `x[1:4, [[1], [2]]` are supported.\n\n### Purely Integer Array Indexing\nWhen the index consists of as many integer arrays as the array being indexed has dimensions, the indexing is straight forward, but different from slicing.\n\nAdvanced indexes always are [broadcast](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/ufuncs.html#ufuncs-broadcasting) and iterated as one:\n```\nresult[i_1, ..., i_M] == x[ind_1[i_1, ..., i_M], ind_2[i_1, ..., i_M],\n                           ..., ind_N[i_1, ..., i_M]]\n```\nNote that the result shape is identical to the (broadcast) indexing array shapes `ind_1, ..., ind_N`.\n\n**Example:**\nFrom each row, a specific element should be selected. The row index is just [0, 1, 2] and the column index specifies the element to choose for the corresponding row, here [0, 1, 0]. Using both together the task can be solved using advanced indexing:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "x = nd.array([[1, 2],\n              [3, 4],\n              [5, 6]], dtype='int32')\nx[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "    [1 4 5]\n    <NDArray 3 @cpu(0)>\n\n\n\nTo achieve a behavior similar to the basic slicing above, broadcasting can be used. This is best understood with an example.\n\nExample:\nFrom a 4x3 array the corner elements should be selected using advanced indexing. Thus all elements for which the column is one of `[0, 2]` and the row is one of `[0, 3]` need to be selected. To use advanced indexing one needs to select all elements explicitly.

Let's look at examples to understand each one's behavior.\n\n- There is only one advanced index in the selection object. For example, `x` is an `NDArray` with `shape=(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)` and `result=x[:, :, ind]` has one advanced index `ind` with `shape=(2, 3, 4)` on the third axis. The `result` will have `shape=(10, 20, 2, 3, 4, 40, 50)` because the subspace of `x` in the third dimension is replaced by the subspace of `shape=(2, 3, 4)`. If we let _i_, _j_, _k_ loop over the (2, 3, 4)-shaped subspace, it is equivalent to `result[:, :, i, j, k, :, :] = x[:, :, ind[i, j, k], :, :]`.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "import numpy as np\nshape = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\nx = nd.arange(np.prod(shape), dtype='int32').reshape(shape)\nind = nd.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))\nprint(x[:, :, ind].shape)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "    (10, 20, 2, 3, 4, 40, 50)\n\n\n- There are at least two advanced indices in the selection object, and all the advanced indices are adjacent to each other. For example, `x` is an `NDArray` with `shape=(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)` and `result=x[:, :, ind1, ind2, :]` has two advanced indices with shapes that are broadcastable to `shape=(2, 3, 4)`. Then the `result` has `shape=(10, 20, 2, 3, 4, 50)` because `(30, 40)`-shaped subspace has been replaced with `(2, 3, 4)`-shaped subspace from the indices.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "ind1 = [0, 1, 2, 3]\nind2 = [[[0], [1], [2]], [[3], [4], [5]]]\nprint(x[:, :, ind1, ind2, :].shape)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "    (10, 20, 2, 3, 4, 50)\n\n\n- There are at least two advanced indices in the selection object, and there is at least one advanced index separated from the others by basic indices.
