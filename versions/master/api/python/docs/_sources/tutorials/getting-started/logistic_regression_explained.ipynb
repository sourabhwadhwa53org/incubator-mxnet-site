Because classes  of the logistic regression are either 0 or 1, we are using [SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss](../../api/gluon/loss/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.loss.SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss). Notice that we do not specify `from_sigmoid` attribute in the code, which means that the output of the neuron doesn't need to go through sigmoid, but at inference we'd have to pass it through sigmoid. You can learn more about cross entropy on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy).\n",

As mentioned before, we need to apply `Sigmoid` function to the output of the neuron to get a probability of belonging to the class 1. But `Sigmoid` function produces output in range [0; 1], and all numbers in that range are going to be casted to 0, even if it is as high as 0.99.
