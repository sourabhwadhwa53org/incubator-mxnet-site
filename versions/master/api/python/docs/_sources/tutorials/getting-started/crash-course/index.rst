Getting started with NP on MXNet
================================

This crash course shows how to get started with NP on MXNet. The topics here provide a quick overview of the core concepts for both NP on MXNet, which helps you manipulate multiple dimensional arrays, and Gluon, which helps you create and train neural
networks. This is a good place to start if you are already familiar with machine learning or other deep learning frameworks.
