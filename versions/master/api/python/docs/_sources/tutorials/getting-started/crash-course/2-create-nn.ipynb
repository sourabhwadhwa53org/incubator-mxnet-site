    "# Step 2: Create a neural network  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In this step, you learn how to use NP on Apache MXNet to create neural networks  \n",
    "in Gluon. In addition to the `np` package that you learned about in the previous  \n",
    "step [Step 1: Manipulate data with NP on MXNet](1-nparray.md), you also need to  \n",
    "import the neural network modules from `gluon`. Gluon includes built-in neural  \n",
    "network layers in the following two modules:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "1. `mxnet.gluon.nn`: NN module that maintained by the mxnet team  \n",
    "2. `mxnet.gluon.contrib.nn`: Experiemental module that is contributed by the  \n",
    "community  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Use the following commands to import the packages required for this step.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "from mxnet import np, npx  \n",
    "from mxnet.gluon import nn  \n",
    "npx.set_np()  # Change MXNet to the numpy-like mode.  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Create your neural network's first layer  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In this section, you will create a simple neural network with Gluon. One of the  \n",
    "simplest network you can create is a single **Dense** layer or **densely-  \n",
    "connected** layer. A dense layer consists of nodes in the input that are  \n",
    "connected to every node in the next layer. Use the following code example to  \n",
    "start with a dense layer with five output units.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "layer = nn.Dense(5)  \n",
    "layer   \n",
    "# output: Dense(-1 -> 5, linear)  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In the example above, the output is `Dense(-1 -> 5, linear)`. The **-1** in the  \n",
    "output denotes that the size of the input layer is not specified during  \n",
    "initialization.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "You can also call the **Dense** layer with an `in_units` parameter if you know  \n",
    "the shape of your input unit.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "layer = nn.Dense(5,in_units=3)  \n",
    "layer  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In addition to the `in_units` param, you can also add an activation function to  \n",
    "the layer using the `activation` param. The Dense layer implements the operation  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$$output = \\sigma(W \\cdot X + b)$$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Call the Dense layer with an `activation` parameter to use an activation  \n",
    "function.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "layer = nn.Dense(5, in_units=3,activation='relu')  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Voila! Congratulations on creating a simple neural network. But for most of your  \n",
    "use cases, you will need to create a neural network with more than one dense  \n",
    "layer or with multiple types of other layers. In addition to the `Dense` layer,  \n",
    "you can find more layers at [mxnet nn  \n",
    "layers](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/api/python/docs/api/gluon/nn/index.html#module-  \n",
    "mxnet.gluon.nn)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "So now that you have created a neural network, you are probably wondering how to  \n",
    "pass data into your network?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "First, you need to initialize the network weights, if you use the default  \n",
    "initialization method which draws random values uniformly in the range $[-0.7,  \n",
    "0.7]$. You can see this in the following example.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note**: Initialization is discussed at a little deeper detail in the next  \n",
    "notebook  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "layer.initialize()  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now that you have initialized your network, you can give it data. Passing data  \n",
    "through a network is also called a forward pass. You can do a forward pass with  \n",
    "random data, shown in the following example. First, you create a `(10,3)` shape  \n",
    "random input `x` and feed the data into the layer to compute the output.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "x = np.random.uniform(-1,1,(10,3))  \n",
    "layer(x)  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The layer produces a `(10,5)` shape output from your `(10,3)` input.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**When you don't specify the `in_unit` parameter, the system  automatically  \n",
    "infers it during the first time you feed in data during the first forward step  \n",
    "after you create and initialize the weights.**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "layer.params  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The `weights` and `bias` can be accessed using the `.data()` method.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "## Chain layers into a neural network using nn.Sequential  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Sequential provides a special way of rapidly building networks when when the  \n",
    "network architecture follows a common design pattern: the layers look like a  \n",
    "stack of pancakes. Many networks follow this pattern: a bunch of layers, one  \n",

    "(pass in the layers by calling `net.add(<Layer goes here!>`). To do this you can  \n",
    "use your previous example of Dense layers and create a 3-layer multi layer  \n",

    "  \n",
    "In gluon, every neural network layer is defined by using a base class  \n",

    "## Saving and Loading your models  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The Blocks API also includes saving your models during and after training so  \n",
    "that you can host the model for inference or avoid training the model again from  \n",
    "scratch. Another reason would be to train your model using one language (like  \n",
    "Python that has a lot of tools for training) and run inference using a different  \n",
    "language.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There are two ways to save your model in MXNet.  \n",
    "1. Save/load the model weights/parameters only  \n",
    "2. Save/load the model weights/parameters and the architectures  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### 1. Save/load the model weights/parameters only\n",
    "  \n",
    "You can use `save_parameters` and `load_parameters` method to save and load the  \n",
    "model weights. Take your simplest model `layer` and save your parameters first.  \n",
    "The model parameters are the params that you save **after** you train your  \n",
    "model.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "file_name = 'layer.params'  \n",
    "layer.save_parameters(file_name)  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "And now load this model again. To load the parameters into a model, you will  \n",
    "first have to build the model. To do this, you will need to create a simple  \n",
    "function to build it.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "def build_model():  \n",
    " layer = nn.Dense(5, in_units=3,activation='relu') return layer  \n",
    "layer_new = build_model()  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "layer_new.load_parameters('layer.params')  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note**: The `save_parameters` and `load_parameters` method is used for models  \n",
    "that use a `Block` method instead of  `HybridBlock` method to build the model.  \n",
    "These models may have complex architectures where the model architectures may  \n",
    "change during execution. E.g. if you have a model that uses an if-else  \n",
    "conditional statement to choose between two different architectures.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. Save/load the model weights/parameters and the architectures\n",
    "  \n",
    "For models that use the **HybridBlock**, the model architecture stays static and  \n",
    "do no change during execution. Therefore both model parameters **AND**  \n",
    "architecture can be saved and loaded using `export`, `imports` methods.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now look at your `MLP_Hybrid` model and export the model using the `export`  \n",
    "function. The export function will export the model architecture into a `.json`  \n",
    "file and model parameters into a `.params` file.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "net_Hybrid.export('MLP_hybrid')  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "```python  \n",
    "net_Hybrid.export('MLP_hybrid')  \n",
    "```  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Similarly, to load this model back, you can use `gluon.nn.SymbolBlock`. To  \n",
    "demonstrate that, load the network serialized above.  \n",

    "In MXNet, the `Block.Summary()` method allows you to view the block’s shape  \n",
    "arguments and view the block’s parameters. When you combine multiple blocks into  \n",

    "summary, the total parameters, and the order of the blocks within the model. To  \n",
    "do this the `Block.summary()` method requires one forward pass of the data,  \n",

    "`net_Hybrid.summary(x_bench)`. To print the summary for `net_Hybrid`, call  \n",
    "another instance of the same network and instantiate it for our summary and then  \n",
    "hybridize it  \n",
