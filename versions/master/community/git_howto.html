<h1 id="git-usage-tips">Git Usage Tips</h1>

<p>Here are some tips for git workflow.</p>

<p>## How to resolve conflict with master</p>

<ul>
  <li>First rebase to most recent master</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># The first two steps can be skipped after you do it once.</span>
git remote add upstream git@github.com:apache/incubator-mxnet.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>The git may show some conflicts it cannot merge, say
<code class="highlighter-rouge">conflicted.py</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Manually modify the file to resolve the conflict.</li>
      <li>After you resolved the conflict, mark it as resolved by</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add conflicted.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Then you can continue rebase by</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git rebase <span class="nt">--continue</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Finally push to your fork, you may need to force push here.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push <span class="nt">--force</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-manage-branches">How to manage branches</h2>

<p>We recommend to always reserve the master branch for synchronizing with upstream.
For development of new features, create a new branch for each feature:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout <span class="nt">-b</span> fancy_new_feature
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The benefit of this practices is that you can easily rebase onto the latest master
changes with little effort</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git pull upstream master <span class="nt">--rebase</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-combine-multiple-commits-into-one">How to combine multiple commits into one</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want to combine multiple commits, especially when later
commits are only fixes to previous ones, to create a PR with set of
meaningful commits. You can do it by following steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before doing so, configure the default editor of git if you haven't
done so before.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config core.editor <span class="o">[</span>the-editor-you-like]
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Assume we want to merge last 3 commits, type the following commands</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git rebase <span class="nt">-i</span> HEAD~3
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>It will pop up an text editor. Set the first commit as
[pick]{.title-ref}, and change later ones to [squash]{.title-ref}.</li>
  <li>After you saved the file, it will pop up another text editor to ask
you modify the combined commit message.</li>
  <li>Push the changes to your fork, you need to force push.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push <span class="nt">--force</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="reset-to-the-most-recent-master">Reset to the most recent master</h2>

<p>You can always use git reset to reset your version to the most recent
master. Note that all your <strong>*local changes will get lost</strong>*. So only
do it when you do not have local changes or when your pull request just
get merged.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git reset <span class="nt">--hard</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">hash </span>tag of master]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="recover-a-previous-commit-after-reset">Recover a Previous Commit after Reset</h2>

<p>Sometimes we could mistakenly reset a branch to a wrong commit. When
that happens, you can use the following command to show the list of
recent commits</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git reflog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you get the right hashtag, you can use git reset again to change
the head to the right commit.</p>

<h2 id="apply-only-k-latest-commits-on-to-the-master">Apply only k-Latest Commits on to the master</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to only apply your k-latest changes on top of the
master. This usually happens when you have other m-commits that are
already merged before these k-commits. Directly rebase against the
master might cause merge conflicts on these first m-commits(which are
can be safely discarded).</p>

<p>You can instead use the following command</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># k is the concrete number</span>
<span class="c"># Put HEAD~2 for the last 1 commit.</span>
git rebase <span class="nt">--onto</span> upstream/master HEAD~k
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can then force push to the master. Note that the above command will
discard all the commits before the last k ones.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-consequence-of-force-push">What is the consequence of force push</h2>

<p>The previous two tips requires force push, this is because we altered
the path of the commits. It is fine to force push to your own fork, as
long as the commits changed are only yours.</p>
