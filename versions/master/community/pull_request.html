<h1 id="submit-a-pull-request">Submit a Pull Request</h1>

<p>This is a quick guide to submit a pull request, please also refer to the
detailed guidelines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before submit, please rebase your code on the most recent version of
master, you can do it by</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:apache/incubator-mxnet.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure code style check pass by typing the following command, and
all the existing test-cases pass.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Reproduce the lint procedure in the CI.</span>
ci/build.py <span class="nt">-R</span> <span class="nt">--docker-registry</span> mxnetci <span class="nt">--platform</span> ubuntu_cpu <span class="nt">--docker-build-retries</span> 3 <span class="nt">--shm-size</span> 500m /work/runtime_functions.sh sanity
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add test-cases to cover the new features or bugfix the patch
introduces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Document the code you wrote, see more at <a href="/versions/master/community/document">Write Document and Tutorials</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send the pull request and fix the problems reported by automatic
checks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Request code reviews from other contributors and improves your patch
according to feedbacks.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To get your code reviewed quickly, we encourage you to help
review others' code so they can do the favor in return.</li>
      <li>Code review is a shepherding process that helps to improve
contributor's code quality. We should treat it proactively, to
improve the code as much as possible before the review. We
highly value patches that can get in without extensive reviews.</li>
      <li>The detailed guidelines and summarizes useful lessons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The patch can be merged after the reviewers approve the pull
request.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ci-environment">CI Environment</h2>

<p>We use docker containers to create stable CI environments that can be
deployed to multiple machines. Because we want a relatively stable CI
environment and make use of pre-cached image, all of the CI images are
built and maintained by committers.</p>

<p>Upgrade of CI base images are done automatically from the MXNet master branch
CI builds, tracked in <a href="https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-docker-cache-refresh/activity">restricted-docker-cache-refresh</a>.
Sometimes this can be broken and needs fixes to accommodate
the new env. When this happens, send a PR to fix the build script in the repo.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>Even though we have hooks to run unit tests automatically for each pull
request, It's always recommended to run unit tests locally beforehand
to reduce reviewers' burden and speedup review process.</p>

<h3 id="c">C++</h3>

<p>C++ tests are maintained in <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/tests/cpp">/tests/cpp</a> and requires <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">gtest</a> to build and run. Once you complete building the MXNet binary, tests are automatically built and generated in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/build/tests/mxnet_unit_tests</code>.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>The dependencies for testing pipelines can be found in <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/ci/docker/install/requirements">/ci/docker/install/requirements</a>. To install these dependencies:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--user</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> ci/docker/install/requirements
</code></pre></div></div>
