You can follow [How to build and install MXNet with MKL-DNN backend](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/mkldnn/MKLDNN_README.html) to build and install MXNet from source. Also, you can install the release or nightly version via PyPi and pip directly by running:\n\n```\n# release version\npip install mxnet-mkl\n# nightly version\npip install mxnet-mkl --pre\n```\n\n## Image Classification Demo\n\nA quantization script [imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py) has been designed to launch quantization for image-classification models. This script is  integrated with [Gluon-CV modelzoo](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/classification.html), so that all pre-trained models can be downloaded from Gluon-CV and then converted for quantization. For details, you can refer [Model Quantization with Calibration Examples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/README.md).\n\n## Integrate Quantization Flow to Your Project\n\nQuantization flow works for both symbolic and Gluon models. If you're using Gluon, you can first refer [Saving and Loading Gluon Models](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/tutorials/gluon/save_load_params.html) to hybridize your computation graph and export it as a symbol before running quantization.\n\nIn general, the quantization flow includes 4 steps. The user can get the acceptable accuracy from step 1 to 3 with minimum effort. Most of thing in this stage is out-of-box and the data scientists and researchers only need to focus on how to represent data and layers in their model. After a quantized model is generated, you may want to deploy it online and the performance will be the next key point. Thus, step 4, calibration, can improve the performance a lot by reducing lots of runtime calculation.\n\n![quantization flow](https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/raw/master/mxnet/tutorials/mkldnn/quantization/quantization.png)\n\nNow, we are going to take Gluon ResNet18 as an example to show how each step work.\n\n### Initialize Model", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "import logging\nimport mxnet as mx\nfrom mxnet.gluon.model_zoo import vision\nfrom mxnet.contrib.quantization import *\n\nlogging.basicConfig()\nlogger = logging.getLogger('logger')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\nbatch_shape = (1, 3, 224, 224)\nresnet18 = vision.resnet18_v1(pretrained=True)\nresnet18.hybridize()\nresnet18.forward(mx.nd.zeros(batch_shape))\nresnet18.export('resnet18_v1')\nsym, arg_params, aux_params = mx.model.load_checkpoint('resnet18_v1', 0)\n# (optional) visualize float32 model\nmx.viz.plot_network(sym)", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "First, we download resnet18-v1 model from gluon modelzoo and export it as a symbol.
