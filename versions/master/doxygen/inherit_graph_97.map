This object, upon construction, prepares an aux stream for use by syncing it with enqueued primary&#45;stream work. Object destruction will sync again so future primary&#45;stream work will wait on enqueued aux&#45;stream work. If MXNET_GPU_WORKER_NSTREAMS == 1, then this defaults simply: the primary stream will equal the aux stream and the syncs will be executed as nops. See ./src/operator/cudnn/cudnn_convolution&#45;inl.h for a usage example. " alt="" coords="5,5,224,32"/>
