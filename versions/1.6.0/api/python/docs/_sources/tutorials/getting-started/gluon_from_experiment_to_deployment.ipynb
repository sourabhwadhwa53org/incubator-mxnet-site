    "# Gluon: from experiment to deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "MXNet Gluon API comes with a lot of great features, and it can provide you everything you need: from experimentation to deploying the model. In this tutorial, we will walk you through a common use case on how to build a model using gluon, train it on your data, and deploy it for inference.\n",
    "This tutorial covers training and inference in Python, please continue to [C++ inference part](/api/cpp/docs/tutorials/cpp_inference) after you finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you need to build a service that provides flower species recognition. A common problem is that you don't have enough data to train a good model. In such cases, a technique called Transfer Learning can be used to make a more robust model.\n",
    "In Transfer Learning we make use of a pre-trained model that solves a related task, and was trained on a very large standard dataset, such as ImageNet. ImageNet is from a different domain, but we can utilize the knowledge in this pre-trained model to perform the new task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gluon provides State of the Art models for many of the standard tasks such as Classification, Object Detection, Segmentation, etc. In this tutorial we will use the pre-trained model [ResNet50 V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027) trained on ImageNet dataset. This model achieves 77.11% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We seek to transfer as much knowledge as possible for our task of recognizing different species of flowers.\n",
