    "When training deep neural networks there are a number of techniques that are thought to be essential for model convergence. One important area is deciding how to initialize the parameters of the network. Using techniques such as [Xavier](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/optimization/optimization.html#mxnet.initializer.Xavier) initialization, we can can improve the gradient flow through the network at the start of training. Another important technique is normalization: i.e. scaling and shifting certain values towards a distribution with a mean of 0 (i.e. zero-centered) and a standard distribution of 1 (i.e. unit variance). Which values you normalize depends on the exact method used as we'll see later on.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why does this help? [Some research](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7515-how-does-batch-normalization-help-optimization.pdf) has found that networks with normalization have a loss function that's easier to optimize using stochastic gradient descent. Other reasons are that it prevents saturation of activations and prevents certain features from dominating due to differences in scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first applications of normalization is on the input data to the network. You can do this with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1** is to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the entire training dataset. You'll usually want to do this for each channel separately. Sometimes you'll see normalization on images applied per pixel, but per channel is more common.\n",
    "* **Step 2** is to use these statistics to normalize each batch for training and for inference too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: A `BatchNorm` layer at the start of your network can have a similar effect (see 'Beta and Gamma' section for details on how this can be achieved). You won't need to manually calculate and keep track of the normalization statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: You should calculate the normalization means and standard deviations using the training dataset only. Any leakage of information from you testing dataset will effect the reliability of your testing metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using pre-trained models from the [Gluon Model Zoo](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/gluon/model_zoo.html) you'll usually see the normalization statistics used for training (i.e. statistics from step 1). You'll want to use these statistics to normalize your own input data for fine-tuning or inference with these models. Using `transforms.Normalize` is one way of applying the normalization, and this should be used in the `Dataset`."

    "\n",
    "We don't have to limit ourselves to normalizing the inputs to the network either. A similar idea can be applied inside the network too, and we can normalize activations between certain layer operations. With deep neural networks most of the convergence benefits described are from this type of normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "MXNet Gluon has 3 of the most commonly used normalization blocks: `BatchNorm`, `LayerNorm` and `InstanceNorm`. You can use them in networks just like any other MXNet Gluon Block, and are often used after `Activation` Blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch Out: Check the architecture of models carefully because sometimes the normalization is applied before the `Activation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced: all of the following methods begin by normalizing certain input distribution (i.e. zero-centered with unit variance), but then shift by (a trainable parameter) beta and scale by (a trainable parameter) gamma. Overall the effect is changing the input distribution to have a mean of beta and a variance of gamma, also allowing to the network to 'undo' the effect of the normalization if necessary.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most popular normalization techniques is Batch Normalization, usually called BatchNorm for short. We normalize the activations **across all samples in a batch** for each of the channels independently. See Figure 1. We calculate two batch (or local) statistics for every channel to perform the normalization: the mean and variance of the activations in that channel for all samples in a batch. And we use these to shift and scale respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: we can use this at the start of a network to perform data normalization, although this is not exactly equivalent to the data normalization example seen above (that had fixed normalization statistics). With `BatchNorm` the normalization statistics depend on the batch, so could change each batch, and there can also be a post-normalization shift and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: the estimates for the batch mean and variance can themselves have high variance when the batch size is small (or when the spatial dimensions of samples are small). This can lead to instability during training, and unreliable estimates for the global statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: it seems that `BatchNorm` is better suited to convolutional networks (CNNs) than recurrent networks (RNNs). We expect the input distribution to the recurrent cell to change over time, so normalization over time doesn't work well. `LayerNorm` is better suited for this case. When you do *need* to use `BatchNorm` on sequential data, make sure the `axis` parameter is set correctly. With data in NTC format you should set `axis=2` (or `axis=-1` equivalently). See Figure 2.\n",
