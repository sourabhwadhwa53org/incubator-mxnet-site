    "Loss functions are used to train neural networks and to compute the difference between output and target variable. A critical component of training neural networks is the loss function. A loss function is a quantative measure of how bad the predictions of the network are when compared to ground truth labels. Given this score, a network can improve by iteratively updating its weights to minimise this loss. Some tasks use a combination of multiple loss functions, but often you'll just use one. MXNet Gluon provides a number of the most commonly used loss functions, and you'll choose certain loss functions depending on your network and task. Some common task and loss function pairs include:\n",
